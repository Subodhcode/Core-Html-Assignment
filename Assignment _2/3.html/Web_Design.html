            User experience (UX) is at the core of web design. A well-designed website ensures easy navigation, swift loading times, and compatibility across diverse devices and screen sizes. Accessibility is a key consideration, ensuring that people of all abilities can use and enjoy the site.
            Technology plays a pivotal role in web design. Contemporary web designers harness the power of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create dynamic and responsive websites. Content management systems like WordPress facilitate content updates and site maintenance.
